# DataScienceCapstone
DataScienceCapstone project

The Coursera Data Science Specialization Capstone project from Johns Hopkins University (JHU), partnered with SwiftKey (http://swiftkey.com/en/), is to deploy an interactive R Shiny application that predicts the next word based on a given input.

The objective of this project is to build a Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word based on a predictive text model. The data used in the model came from a corpus called HC Corpora (www.corpora.heliohost.org). 

## Working Shiny app is available at:
